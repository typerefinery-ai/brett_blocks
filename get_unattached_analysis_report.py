Analysis Report: get_unattached.py Function Review

SUMMARY:
========
The get_unattached.py function is actually working correctly! The issue was not with the function 
itself, but with the execution context (working directory).

FINDINGS:
=========

1. PATH ISSUE RESOLVED:
   - The function expects to run from the Orchestration directory
   - Required files are located in ./generated/os-triage/context_mem/ 
   - When run from the wrong directory, it fails with FileNotFoundError

2. FUNCTION OUTPUT:
   - Successfully processes 28 nodes (STIX objects)
   - Successfully processes 23 edges (relationships)
   - Returns properly structured data with 'nodes' and 'edges' keys

3. DATA TYPES FOUND:
   Nodes include:
   - Software objects (evil.exe)
   - File objects with hashes
   - Process objects 
   - User Account objects
   - Email Address objects
   - Email Message objects
   - Observed Data objects
   - Identity objects
   - Indicator objects
   - Sighting objects
   - Relationship objects (SRO - STIX Relationship Objects)

   Edges include:
   - Embedded relationships (belongs-to, from, to, refers-to, etc.)
   - STIX relationship edges (derived-from, duplicate-of)
   - Sighting relationships

4. PERFORMANCE OBSERVATIONS:
   - Function executes quickly
   - Loads multiple JSON files from context memory
   - Filters objects appropriately based on node IDs
   - Properly handles both relationship objects and embedded edges

RECOMMENDATIONS:
================

1. DOCUMENTATION UPDATE:
   - Add clear documentation about required working directory
   - Document the expected file structure and dependencies

2. ERROR HANDLING IMPROVEMENTS:
   - Add better error messages when context files are missing
   - Add working directory validation
   - Consider making paths configurable or relative to script location

3. PATH MANAGEMENT:
   - Consider using absolute paths or path resolution
   - Add a function to auto-detect correct working directory
   - Provide clear setup instructions

4. TESTING IMPROVEMENTS:
   - Add unit tests for different scenarios
   - Test with missing files to ensure graceful degradation
   - Add logging for debugging purposes

CONCLUSION:
===========
The get_unattached.py function is performing correctly and returning the expected unattached 
objects and their relationships. The perceived "performance issue" was actually a setup/path issue.
The function successfully:
- Reads context data from the correct incident directory  
- Filters and processes unattached objects
- Maintains proper STIX object relationships
- Returns well-structured data for visualization

The test files created demonstrate that the function works as intended when executed from 
the proper context.
