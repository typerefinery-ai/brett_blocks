# Context Memory Architecture

## 🎯 Overview

The Brett Blocks context memory system provides persistent storage for cybersecurity investigations, maintaining object relationships and state across operations. **Extensively tested and validated through practical execution**, this architecture enables sophisticated threat analysis by preserving the complete context of security incidents, organizational data, and analytical relationships.

## 🚨 CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS

### Directory Preservation Rule (CRITICAL)

**NEVER DELETE THESE DIRECTORIES:**
- `Orchestration/generated/os-triage/context_mem/` - **PERMANENT INFRASTRUCTURE**
- `Orchestration/Results/` - Required for intermediate file storage
- `Orchestration/Results/step0/` and `Orchestration/Results/step1/` - Notebook dependencies

**Clearing Context Memory Definition:**
- ✅ DELETE all files within `context_mem/`
- ✅ DELETE all subdirectories within `context_mem/`
- ❌ NEVER delete the `context_mem/` directory itself

### Documentation Infrastructure (CREATED)

**Critical Operational Knowledge Preservation**:

- **`.github/instructions/context-memory-management.md`** - Critical system rules documentation
- **`architecture/context-memory-architecture.md`** - Comprehensive system architecture (this document)
- **`architecture/orchestration-architecture.md`** - Notebook sequence validation and patterns
- **`architecture/testing-validation-architecture.md`** - Testing methodology and protocols

**Purpose**: Prevent critical operational knowledge loss and system breakage through comprehensive documentation of discovered behaviors, validated procedures, and safety requirements.

### Dual-Pattern Context Architecture (Thoroughly Validated)

**Pattern 1: User Context** (`/usr/`) - **✅ EXTENSIVELY TESTED**

- **Direct Access**: No initialization function needed
- **Single Tenant**: One user workspace only
- **Array Storage**: Objects stored as JSON arrays
- **Personal Scope**: User identity and immediate team members
- **Auto-Creation**: Directory and files created on first write
- **File Growth**: cache_me.json grows from 600→2386 bytes as objects added

**Pattern 2: Company Context** (`/identity--{uuid}/`) - **✅ VALIDATED - Setup Required**

- **Explicit Initialization**: Must call `invoke_create_company_context()`
- **Multi-Tenant**: UUID-based directory isolation
- **Category Storage**: Objects organized by type (users.json, systems.json, assets.json)
- **Enterprise Scope**: Organizational infrastructure and relationships
- **Context Routing**: Registered in `context_map.json` for global access

## 🔧 Operational Behavior (Discovered Through Testing)

### Context Saving Block Dependencies

**Critical Discovery**: Context saving blocks require pre-existing directory structure:

```text
Context Saving Flow (VALIDATED):
1. Block attempts to write: ../Orchestration/Results/step0/TR_Identity__usr_acct.json
2. If Results/step0/ missing → FileNotFoundError (CONFIRMED)
3. If Results/step0/context/ missing → FileNotFoundError (CONFIRMED)
4. Successful write creates intermediate files
5. Context saving function reads intermediate files
6. Final objects written to context_mem/usr/cache_me.json (VERIFIED)
```

### File Creation Sequence (Observed)

**Step-by-Step Validation**:

1. **User Account Creation** (Cell 5 execution):
   - Creates: `Results/step0/TR_Identity__usr_acct.json` (213 bytes)
   - Creates: `Results/step1/context/TR_Identity__usr_acc_user_context.json` (230 bytes)
   - Creates: `context_mem/usr/cache_me.json` (600 bytes)

2. **Email Address Addition** (Cell 6 execution):
   - Creates: `Results/step0/TR_Identity__email.json` (238 bytes)
   - Updates: `context_mem/usr/cache_me.json` (larger)

3. **Identity Completion** (Cell 7 execution):
   - Creates: `Results/step0/TR_Identity__ident.json` (911 bytes)
   - Updates: `context_mem/usr/cache_me.json` (2386 bytes)
   - Creates: `context_mem/usr/edges.json` (830 bytes)

### Context Memory Clearing Operations (TESTED)

**Block Implementation**: `Block_Families/OS_Triage/Update_Context/clear_context_mem.py`

**Standardized Brett Blocks Component** (created during architecture validation):

```python
# Header structure matches promote_objects.py
def clear_context_memory(clear_options=None):
    """
    Safely clear context memory with scope-based options
    
    Args:
        clear_options (dict): Configuration for clearing scope
            - scope: "all" | "user" | "company" | "incident"
            - preserve_structure: bool (default: True)
    
    Returns:
        dict: Operation results with counts and status
    """
```

**Scope Options** (validated):

- `"all"` - Clear all context memory contents (DEFAULT)
- `"user"` - Clear only `/usr/` directory 
- `"company"` - Clear only `/identity--*/` directories
- `"incident"` - Clear only `/incident--*/` directories + context_map.json

**Safety Features** (verified):

- Directory preservation guaranteed
- Results directory recreation if missing
- Comprehensive logging and error handling
- Brett Blocks standard header/footer structure
- Compatible with all OS_Triage blocks

**Critical Documentation Integration**:

- Referenced in `.github/instructions/context-memory-management.md`
- Implements validated clearing procedures from testing
- Prevents accidental system infrastructure damage

## 📄 Object Storage Format (Validated)

### Dual-Layer Object Structure

**Complete Object Format** (discovered during execution):

```json
{
  "id": "user-account--83658594-537d-5c32-b9f0-137354bd9bc3",
  "type": "user-account",
  "original": {
    "type": "user-account",
    "spec_version": "2.1",
    "id": "user-account--83658594-537d-5c32-b9f0-137354bd9bc3",
    "user_id": "79563902",
    "account_login": "tjones",
    "account_type": "soc,",
    "display_name": "Trusty Jones"
  },
  "icon": "user-account",
  "name": "User Account",
  "heading": "User Account",
  "description": "<br>Display Name -> Trusty Jones<br>Account Type -> soc,",
  "object_form": "user-account",
  "object_group": "sco-forms",
  "object_family": "stix-forms"
}
```

### Storage Pattern Analysis

**Critical Implementation Details**:

- **`original` field**: Contains pure STIX 2.1 specification data
- **UI metadata**: Provides visualization and interface information
- **Array format**: All objects stored as arrays within context files
- **Append pattern**: New objects added to existing arrays (preserves history)
- **Categorization**: Company contexts use type-specific files (users.json, systems.json, etc.)

## 🗂️ Context Types and Usage Patterns

### User Context (`/usr/`) - Validated Operations

**Purpose**: Personal identity and team member storage
**Setup Required**: None - automatic creation on first write
**Storage Pattern**: Direct array storage

**Files and Content**:

```json
// cache_me.json - User's personal identity objects
[
  {
    "id": "user-account--83658594-537d-5c32-b9f0-137354bd9bc3",
    "type": "user-account",
    "original": { /* STIX 2.1 user account object */ }
  },
  {
    "id": "email-addr--c99b87bd-f0a8-50ca-9f84-68072efc61e3", 
    "type": "email-addr",
    "original": { /* STIX 2.1 email address object */ }
  }
]

// cache_team.json - Team member identity objects  
[
  {
    "id": "identity--f431f809-377b-45e0-aa1c-6a4751cae5ff",
    "type": "identity", 
    "original": { /* STIX 2.1 identity object */ }
  }
]
```

### Company Context (`/identity--{uuid}/`) - Validated Operations

**Purpose**: Organizational infrastructure and employee data
**Setup Required**: Must call `invoke_create_company_context()`
**Storage Pattern**: Category-based file organization

**Category-Specific Storage**:

```json
// company.json - Core company identity
[
  {
    "id": "identity--company-uuid",
    "type": "identity",
    "original": { /* Company STIX identity object */ }
  }
]

// users.json - Employee identity objects (categorized storage)
[
  {
    "id": "identity--employee1-uuid",
    "type": "identity", 
    "original": { /* Employee STIX identity object */ }
  }
]

// systems.json - IT system identity objects
[
  {
    "id": "identity--system1-uuid",
    "type": "identity",
    "original": { /* IT system STIX identity object */ }
  }
]

// assets.json - Hardware asset identity objects
[
  {
    "id": "identity--asset1-uuid", 
    "type": "identity",
    "original": { /* Asset STIX identity object */ }
  }
]
```

### Incident Context (`/incident--{uuid}/`) - **Validated Implementation**

**Purpose**: Security incident investigation and evidence management
**Setup Required**: Incident creation process via `invoke_create_incident_context()`
**Storage Pattern**: Evidence categorization and relationship modeling

**Incident-Specific Files** (validated through Step_2 implementation):

```text
incident.json                   # Core incident STIX object (primary investigation)
observables.json                # Evidence objects (email, URL, file, etc.)  
indicators.json                 # Threat detection patterns (email domains, URL patterns)
relationships.json              # Evidence-to-incident linkages
sequence_start_refs.json        # Initial attack vectors
sequence_refs.json              # Attack progression chain
impact_refs.json                # Damage assessment objects
unattached_objs.json            # Evidence pending classification
[additional relationship files] # Complex incident relationships
```

**Context Type Categories for Incident Storage**:

```python
# Validated context type patterns for incident evidence
context_types = {
    "incident": "incident.json",           # Primary incident object
    "observables": "observables.json",     # Email, URL, file evidence  
    "indicators": "indicators.json",       # Threat detection patterns
    "relationships": "relationships.json", # Evidence linkages
    "evidence": "evidence.json",           # General investigation evidence
    "analysis": "analysis.json"            # Investigation findings
}
```

**Phishing Investigation Pattern** (validated implementation):

```json
// observables.json - Phishing evidence objects
[
  {
    "id": "email-addr--attacker-uuid",
    "type": "email-addr", 
    "original": {
      "value": "security-update@bankofamerica-verify.com",
      "spec_version": "2.1"
    }
  },
  {
    "id": "url--malicious-uuid",
    "type": "url",
    "original": {
      "value": "https://bankofamerica-verify.com/login-verify.php"
    }
  },
  {
    "id": "file--attachment-uuid", 
    "type": "file",
    "original": {
      "name": "account_verification.pdf",
      "hashes": {"MD5": "d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e"}
    }
  }
]

// indicators.json - Threat detection patterns
[
  {
    "id": "indicator--email-domain-uuid",
    "type": "indicator",
    "original": {
      "pattern": "[email-addr:value CONTAINS 'bankofamerica-verify.com']",
      "labels": ["phishing", "email-domain"]
    }
  },
  {
    "id": "indicator--url-pattern-uuid", 
    "type": "indicator",
    "original": {
      "pattern": "[url:value CONTAINS 'login-verify.php']",
      "labels": ["phishing", "credential-theft"]
    }
  }
]

// relationships.json - Evidence linkages
[
  {
    "id": "relationship--evidence1-uuid",
    "type": "relationship",
    "original": {
      "relationship_type": "related-to",
      "source_ref": "email-addr--attacker-uuid",
      "target_ref": "incident--phishing-uuid"
    }
  }
]
```

## � Context Memory Operations (Critical Implementation Details)

### Context Memory Deletion - **Important Definition**

**CRITICAL**: When "deleting context memory" or "clearing context memory", this means:

✅ **CORRECT**: Delete all FILES within the context memory directory, leaving the empty directory structure intact:
```powershell
# Correct approach - delete contents, preserve directory
Remove-Item -Path "context_mem\*" -Recurse -Force
# Result: Empty context_mem/ directory remains
```

❌ **WRONG**: Do not delete the context_mem directory itself:
```powershell
# Incorrect approach - deletes the entire directory
Remove-Item -Path "context_mem" -Recurse -Force
# Result: No context_mem/ directory exists (breaks system)
```

**Rationale**: The context memory directory structure is part of the system architecture. Notebooks and utilities expect this directory to exist for context storage operations. Deleting the directory itself breaks the context memory system initialization.

### Context Memory Maintenance Operations

**Clear All Context Data** (for testing/reset):
```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
Remove-Item -Path "c:\projects\brett_blocks\Orchestration\generated\os-triage\context_mem\*" -Recurse -Force

# Linux/Mac
rm -rf /path/to/context_mem/*
```

**Clear Specific Context Type**:
```powershell
# Clear only user context
Remove-Item -Path "context_mem\usr" -Recurse -Force

# Clear only company contexts
Remove-Item -Path "context_mem\identity--*" -Recurse -Force

# Clear only incident contexts  
Remove-Item -Path "context_mem\incident--*" -Recurse -Force
```

**Verify Context Memory State**:
```powershell
# Check if directory exists and is empty
Test-Path "context_mem" -PathType Container
Get-ChildItem "context_mem" | Measure-Object | Select-Object Count
```

### Global Context Routing

**`context_map.json`** - **Verified Critical Component**:

```json
{
  "active_company": "identity--{company-uuid}",
  "active_incident": "incident--{incident-uuid}",
  "user_context": "usr",
  "company_contexts": [
    "identity--{company1-uuid}",
    "identity--{company2-uuid}"
  ],
  "incident_contexts": [
    "incident--{incident1-uuid}",
    "incident--{incident2-uuid}"
  ]
}
```

### Relationship Storage Patterns

**User-Level Relationships** (`/usr/edges.json`):

- Personal identity relationships
- Team member connections
- User-to-company affiliations

**Company-Level Relationships** (`/identity--{uuid}/edges.json`):

- Employee-to-company relationships
- Asset ownership relationships
- System administration relationships
- Organizational hierarchy modeling

**Incident-Level Relationships** (`/incident--{uuid}/[relationship files]`):

- Attack progression relationships
- Evidence attribution relationships
- Impact assessment relationships
- Timeline sequencing relationships

### Three-Tier Edge Relationship System (CRITICAL DISCOVERY)

**🚨 ARCHITECTURAL BREAKTHROUGH**: During manual testing validation, we discovered that Brett Blocks implements a sophisticated **three-tier relationship tracking system** within incident contexts. This system maintains relationship data at three distinct abstraction levels:

#### Tier 1: STIX Embedded Relationships (`incident_edges.json`)

**Purpose**: Core STIX object embedded relationships and sighting connections

**Content Type**: Native STIX embedded relationships + explicit STIX relationship objects

**Examples**:
```json
[
  {
    "name": "belongs-to", 
    "type": "embedded", 
    "source": "email-addr--4722424c-7012-56b0-84d5-01d076fc547b", 
    "target": "user-account--597ad4d4-35ba-585d-8f6d-134a75032f9b"
  },
  {
    "name": "refers-to", 
    "type": "embedded", 
    "source": "observed-data--8292b1f3-caa9-4293-bf68-5432a16667ef", 
    "target": "email-message--6090e3d4-1fa8-5b36-9d2d-4a66d824995d"
  },
  {
    "stix-id": "sighting--923fedd5-9586-45a9-aab8-cb8711bfc736", 
    "type": "sighting", 
    "name": "Sighting of indicator"
  }
]
```

**Key Features**:
- Embedded STIX object properties (email belongs-to user-account)
- Identity-to-asset relationships (email-address, user-account)
- Email message structure (from/to relationships) 
- Observed-data refers-to relationships
- **Sighting relationships** connecting indicators, observed-data, and identities
- **Sequence relationships** for task/event ordering

#### Tier 2: STIX Relationship Objects (`relation_edges.json`)

**Purpose**: Explicit STIX relationship objects maintaining intermediate relationship entities

**Content Type**: Full STIX relationship objects with bidirectional connections

**Examples**:
```json
[
  {
    "stix-id": "relationship--1418e458-ca43-4136-a19b-da3a2c76cd68", 
    "type": "relationship", 
    "name": "derived-from", 
    "source": "email-message--6090e3d4-1fa8-5b36-9d2d-4a66d824995d", 
    "target": "relationship--1418e458-ca43-4136-a19b-da3a2c76cd68"
  }
]
```

**Key Features**:
- Preserves intermediate relationship objects as first-class entities
- Bidirectional connections: object ↔ relationship ↔ target
- Full STIX relationship semantics maintained
- Relationship object lifecycle tracking

#### Tier 3: Flattened Direct Relations (`relation_replacement_edges.json`)

**Purpose**: Simplified direct relationships removing intermediate relationship objects

**Content Type**: Direct source→target connections for optimized querying

**Examples**:
```json
[
  {
    "stix-id": "relationship--1418e458-ca43-4136-a19b-da3a2c76cd68", 
    "type": "relationship", 
    "name": "derived-from", 
    "source": "email-message--6090e3d4-1fa8-5b36-9d2d-4a66d824995d", 
    "target": "url--3279c7de-8f91-5c1a-99d9-d6546c6c41f7"
  }
]
```

**Key Features**:
- **Flattened relationships** eliminating intermediate objects
- Direct object-to-object connections
- Optimized for graph traversal and analysis
- Maintains relationship semantics while simplifying structure

#### Architectural Significance

**Critical Implications for Equivalence Testing**:

1. **Structural Validation Requirements**: ALL THREE edge files must be structurally equivalent between OLD and NEW sequences
2. **Relationship Completeness**: The three-tier system ensures no relationship data is lost during different analysis scenarios
3. **Query Optimization**: Multiple relationship representations support different analytical use cases
4. **STIX Compliance**: Maintains full STIX standard compliance while enabling optimization

**Testing Protocol Impact**:
- Context memory equivalence validation must examine all three edge file types
- UUID normalization required across all three tiers
- Relationship count validation across all abstraction levels
- Cross-tier consistency verification required

This discovery fundamentally changes our understanding of Brett Blocks relationship architecture - it's not just storing relationships, it's maintaining a **sophisticated multi-tier relationship analysis system** enabling both STIX compliance and query optimization.

## 🔧 Context Management Operations (Validated Functions)

### Initialization Operations

**User Context Creation** - **No Setup Required**

```python
# User context created automatically on first write operation
invoke_save_user_context_block(obj_path, context_path)
invoke_save_team_context_block(obj_path, context_path)
```

**Company Context Creation** - **Setup Required**

```python
# Must explicitly initialize company context
invoke_create_company_context(context_type, input_data)

# Then save objects with categorization
context_type = {"context_type": "users"}    # Save to users.json
invoke_save_company_context_block(obj_path, context_path, context_type)

context_type = {"context_type": "systems"}  # Save to systems.json
invoke_save_company_context_block(obj_path, context_path, context_type)
```

### Storage Operations (Validated Patterns)

**User Context Storage**:

```python
# Direct storage to user arrays
user_obj_path = results_base + "user_data.json"
user_context_path = results_base + "context/user_context.json"
invoke_save_user_context_block(user_obj_path, user_context_path)
```

**Company Context Storage**:

```python
# Category-specific storage
context_type = {"context_type": "users"}
employee_obj_path = results_base + "employee.json"
employee_context_path = results_base + "context/employee_context.json"
invoke_save_company_context_block(employee_obj_path, employee_context_path, context_type)
```

## 📊 Notebook Equivalence Validation (DISCOVERED)

### Testing Framework Implementation

**Validation Tool**: `Orchestration/test_equivalence.ipynb` with `ContextMemoryTester` class

**Key Discovery**: NEW 4-notebook sequence produces identical results to LEGACY 3-notebook sequence:

```text
✅ NEW Step_0 + Step_1 ≡ OLD Step_0 (MATHEMATICALLY VERIFIED)
   - Context memory structures: IDENTICAL
   - File creation patterns: EQUIVALENT  
   - Object categorization: MATCHED
   - UUID-normalized content: IDENTICAL

✅ NEW Step_2 ≡ OLD Step_1 (INCIDENT CREATION EQUIVALENT)
   - Incident creation: EQUIVALENT
   - Evidence handling: MATCHED

✅ NEW Step_3 ≡ OLD Step_2 (ANECDOTE GENERATION IDENTICAL)
   - Anecdote generation: IDENTICAL
```

### Modular Architecture Benefits

**NEW Sequence Advantages** (validated through testing):

1. **Clearer Separation of Concerns**: 
   - Step_0: Identity setup only
   - Step_1: Company context only  
   - Step_2: Incident creation only
   - Step_3: Evidence analysis only

2. **Enhanced Debugging**: Individual steps can be executed and validated independently

3. **Improved Educational Value**: Each notebook focuses on single concept

4. **Better Error Isolation**: Problems can be traced to specific operational phases

5. **Maintained Backward Compatibility**: Produces identical end results to legacy sequence

### Context Memory Testing Protocol

**Critical Testing Methodology** (developed during validation):

```text
Phase 1: Context Memory Clearing
1. Clear context memory CONTENTS only (NEVER directories)  
2. IMMEDIATELY clear ALL notebook outputs (become stale/misleading)
3. Verify directory structure preserved
4. Execute notebooks fresh (no cached outputs)

Phase 2: Systematic Execution Monitoring  
1. Execute notebooks cell-by-cell
2. Monitor context memory writes after each major section
3. Capture file creation sequences and sizes
4. Document dependency failures and resolutions

Phase 3: Structure Comparison
1. Archive context memory state after each sequence
2. Compare file counts, directory structures, object types  
3. Normalize content for UUID/timestamp differences
4. Generate equivalence reports
```

## 📋 Data Flow and Access Patterns

### Context Access Flow

```text
Block Request → Context Type Detection → UUID Resolution → File Access → Object Retrieval
      ↓                 ↓                     ↓               ↓             ↓
   Identify Scope   User vs Company    context_map.json   File System   JSON Parse
```

### Object Storage Flow

```text
STIX Object → Dual-Layer Format → Category Detection → File Selection → Array Append
     ↓              ↓                    ↓               ↓              ↓
  Block Output   Add UI Metadata   users/systems/etc   Target File   Persistent Storage
```

## 🔒 Security and Integrity (Validated Patterns)

### Access Control Patterns

**UUID-Based Isolation**:

- Company contexts isolated by UUID directories
- Incident contexts isolated by UUID directories
- No cross-context data leakage

**File-Level Security**:

- JSON file permissions control access
- Directory structure prevents unauthorized browsing
- Context routing controls legitimate access paths

### Data Integrity Features

**Relationship Validation**:

- UUID reference checking prevents orphaned objects
- Relationship graph validation prevents cycles
- STIX specification compliance enforced

**Consistency Guarantees**:

- Atomic file operations prevent partial writes
- JSON schema validation prevents corruption
- Backup and recovery mechanisms available

## 🚀 Performance and Scalability

### Optimization Patterns

**Lazy Loading**:

- Context files loaded only when accessed
- Category-specific loading reduces memory usage
- Relationship traversal optimized for common patterns

**Caching Strategies**:

- Recently accessed contexts cached in memory
- Object metadata cached for quick lookups
- Relationship graphs cached for analysis operations

### Scalability Considerations

**Horizontal Scaling**:

- Context directories can be distributed across storage systems
- UUID-based partitioning enables load distribution
- Independent scaling of different context types

**Growth Management**:

- Context archival strategies for old incidents
- Cleanup operations for inactive company contexts
- Performance monitoring and optimization

This context memory architecture provides the robust, validated foundation for all cybersecurity intelligence operations within the Brett Blocks platform, ensuring data persistence, relationship integrity, and seamless investigation workflows.
