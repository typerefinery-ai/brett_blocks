# Block Testing and Validation Architecture

## üéØ Overview

The Brett Blocks testing architecture ensures system reliability through systematic validation of context memory operations, notebook sequence equivalence, and infrastructure dependencies. **Developed through practical discovery of critical system behaviors**.

## üß™ Testing Methodology (Validated Approach)

### Context Memory Testing Protocol

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: Context memory clearing affects system state and requires specific protocols:

#### Phase 1: Context Memory Clearing
```text
1. Clear context memory CONTENTS only (NEVER directories)
2. IMMEDIATELY clear ALL notebook outputs (become stale/misleading)
3. Verify directory structure preserved
4. Execute notebooks fresh (no cached outputs)
```

#### Phase 2: Systematic Execution Monitoring
```text
1. Execute notebooks cell-by-cell
2. Monitor context memory writes after each major section
3. Capture file creation sequences and sizes
4. Document dependency failures and resolutions
```

#### Phase 3: Structure Comparison
```text
1. Archive context memory state after each sequence
2. Compare file counts, directory structures, object types
3. Normalize content for UUID/timestamp differences
4. Generate equivalence reports
```

## üìä Equivalence Testing Framework

### Notebook Sequence Validation (Implemented)

**Testing Tool**: `test_equivalence.ipynb` with `ContextMemoryTester` class

**Key Components**:
- **Directory Preservation**: Never delete `context_mem/` infrastructure
- **Content Clearing**: Remove files/subdirs while preserving structure
- **Multi-Path Detection**: Find context memory in various locations
- **Structure Comparison**: Compare file counts and types
- **UUID Normalization**: Ignore UUID differences in content comparison

### Validation Results (CONFIRMED)

```text
‚úÖ NEW Step_0 + Step_1 ‚â° OLD Step_0
   - Context memory structures: IDENTICAL
   - File creation patterns: EQUIVALENT  
   - Object categorization: MATCHED

‚úÖ NEW Step_2 ‚â° OLD Step_1  
   - Incident creation: EQUIVALENT
   - Evidence handling: MATCHED

‚úÖ NEW Step_3 ‚â° OLD Step_2
   - Anecdote generation: IDENTICAL
```

## üîß Infrastructure Dependencies (Discovered)

### Critical Directory Requirements

**DISCOVERED**: Context saving blocks require pre-existing directory structure:

```text
Required Directories (Must exist BEFORE notebook execution):
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Orchestration/generated/os-triage/context_mem/    # PERMANENT
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Orchestration/Results/                            # REQUIRED
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Orchestration/Results/step0/                      # CRITICAL
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Orchestration/Results/step0/context/              # CRITICAL  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Orchestration/Results/step1/                      # CRITICAL
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Orchestration/Results/step1/context/              # CRITICAL
```

**Failure Mode**: Missing directories cause `FileNotFoundError` during context saving.

**Solution**: `clear_context_mem.py` block automatically recreates required structure.

## üõ†Ô∏è Testing Tools and Blocks

### Context Memory Management Block

**Location**: `Block_Families/OS_Triage/Update_Context/clear_context_mem.py`

**Features**:
- Scope-based clearing (all, user, company, incident)
- Directory preservation guaranteed
- Results directory recreation
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

**Usage Pattern**:
```json
{
  "clear_options": {
    "scope": "all",
    "preserve_structure": true
  }
}
```

### Interactive Testing Framework

**Location**: `Orchestration/test_equivalence.ipynb`

**Capabilities**:
- Step-by-step execution monitoring
- Real-time context memory analysis
- Automated structure comparison
- Archive creation and management
- UUID-normalized content comparison

## üìã Testing Best Practices (Validated)

### Pre-Test Setup
1. **Clear context memory contents** (preserve directories)
2. **Clear all notebook outputs** (prevent stale data confusion)
3. **Verify infrastructure directories exist**
4. **Initialize monitoring tools**

### During Test Execution
1. **Execute notebooks cell-by-cell** for precise monitoring
2. **Monitor context memory after each major section**
3. **Document file creation sequences and dependencies**
4. **Capture error conditions and resolutions**

### Post-Test Analysis
1. **Archive context memory states** for comparison
2. **Generate structure comparison reports**
3. **Validate equivalence assertions**
4. **Document any discrepancies or issues**

### Critical Rules
- ‚ùå **NEVER** delete `context_mem/` directory itself
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** clear notebook outputs after context clearing
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** verify directory structure before execution
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** monitor context memory writes during execution

## üéØ Quality Assurance Outcomes
