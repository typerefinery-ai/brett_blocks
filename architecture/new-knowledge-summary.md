# Architecture Updates - New Knowledge Discovery

## 📋 Overview

This document summarizes the **critical new architectural knowledge** discovered through practical implementation and execution of the Brett Blocks system, particularly focusing on incident management, context memory patterns, and validated implementation approaches.

## 🎯 Major Architectural Discoveries

### 1. **Three-Tier Edge Relationship System** - **CRITICAL BREAKTHROUGH** ✅ **Discovered 2025-10-30**

#### **Sophisticated Multi-Level Relationship Architecture**

During manual testing of notebook sequence equivalence, we discovered that Brett Blocks implements a **revolutionary three-tier relationship tracking system** within incident contexts that fundamentally changes our understanding of the relationship architecture.

**Three Distinct Relationship Abstraction Levels**:

1. **Tier 1: STIX Embedded Relationships** (`incident_edges.json`)
   - Native STIX object embedded relationships (email belongs-to user-account)
   - Sighting relationships connecting indicators, observed-data, and identities
   - Sequence relationships for task/event ordering
   - Full STIX compliance maintained

2. **Tier 2: STIX Relationship Objects** (`relation_edges.json`)
   - Explicit STIX relationship objects as first-class entities
   - Bidirectional connections: object ↔ relationship ↔ target
   - Intermediate relationship object lifecycle tracking
   - Full STIX relationship semantics preserved

3. **Tier 3: Flattened Direct Relations** (`relation_replacement_edges.json`)
   - Simplified direct relationships eliminating intermediate objects
   - Direct object-to-object connections for optimized querying
   - Maintains relationship semantics while simplifying structure
   - Graph traversal and analysis optimization

**Architectural Significance**:
- **Testing Impact**: Context memory equivalence validation must examine ALL THREE edge file types
- **Query Optimization**: Multiple relationship representations support different analytical scenarios
- **STIX Compliance**: Maintains full standard compliance while enabling performance optimization
- **Analytical Flexibility**: Supports both detailed forensic analysis and high-performance graph operations

**Discovery Context**: Found during manual testing validation when examining incident directory contents after OLD Step_0 + Step_1 execution.

### 2. **Incident Context Architecture** - **New Implementation**

#### **Step_2 Incident Creation Pattern** ✅ **Validated**

- **Incident Object Creation**: Primary STIX incident with UUID-based context directory
- **Evidence Categorization**: Separate storage for observables, indicators, relationships
- **Context Memory Integration**: Incident-specific storage with global routing
- **Investigation Framework**: Complete evidence chain and threat pattern documentation

#### **Phishing Investigation Implementation** ✅ **Validated**

```text
Incident Context Structure:
incident--{uuid}/
├── incident.json          # Primary incident STIX object
├── observables.json       # Email, URL, file evidence objects  
├── indicators.json        # Threat detection patterns
├── relationships.json     # Evidence-to-incident linkages
├── sequence_start_refs.json # Attack vector initiation
├── sequence_refs.json     # Attack progression chain
├── impact_refs.json       # Business impact assessment
└── unattached_objs.json   # Evidence pending classification
```

#### **Context Type Categories** ✅ **Validated**

```python
# Incident context storage categories (validated through execution)
incident_context_types = {
    "incident": "incident.json",           # Primary incident object
    "observables": "observables.json",     # Evidence objects (email, URL, file)
    "indicators": "indicators.json",       # Threat patterns (email domains, URLs)
    "relationships": "relationships.json", # Evidence linkages to incident
    "evidence": "evidence.json",           # General investigation evidence
    "analysis": "analysis.json"            # Investigation findings
}
```

### 2. **Template Path Resolution** - **Critical Bug Fix**

#### **Validated Path Pattern** ✅ **Critical Discovery**

```python
# ✅ CORRECT PATTERN - Utility functions handle path concatenation internally
path_base = "../Block_Families/StixORM/"  # Set base path once

# Template paths MUST be relative to StixORM directory (no leading path)
incident_template = "SDO/Incident/incident_phishing.json"        # ✅ CORRECT
email_template = "SCO/Email_Addr/email_addr_malicious.json"      # ✅ CORRECT
url_template = "SCO/URL/url_malicious.json"                      # ✅ CORRECT
indicator_template = "SDO/Indicator/indicator_email_domain.json" # ✅ CORRECT

# ❌ WRONG PATTERNS - Double path concatenation (causes file not found errors)
incident_template = "../Block_Families/StixORM/SDO/Incident/..." # ❌ Double path
email_template = f"{path_base}SCO/Email_Addr/..."                # ❌ Manual concat
```

#### **Implementation Impact**

- **Bug Prevention**: Eliminates "file not found" errors in utility functions
- **Path Consistency**: Standardizes template path resolution across all notebooks
- **Utility Function Behavior**: All functions expect relative paths from StixORM base

### 3. **STIX Object Implementation Patterns** - **Expanded Coverage**

#### **Incident Investigation Objects** ✅ **Validated**

**Incident Objects** - Comprehensive phishing investigation modeling:

```json
{
  "type": "incident",
  "name": "Phishing Email Investigation", 
  "incident_type": "phishing-email",
  "investigation_status": "new",
  "description": "Sophisticated phishing attempt targeting employee"
}
```

**Threat Indicators** - Pattern-based detection for future prevention:

```json
{
  "type": "indicator",
  "pattern": "[email-addr:value CONTAINS 'bankofamerica-verify.com']",
  "labels": ["phishing", "email-domain"],
  "valid_from": "2025-10-25T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

**Evidence Relationships** - Linking observables to investigations:

```json
{
  "type": "relationship", 
  "relationship_type": "related-to",
  "source_ref": "email-addr--attacker-uuid",
  "target_ref": "incident--phishing-uuid"
}
```

### 4. **Context Memory Advanced Patterns** - **Enhanced Understanding**

#### **Three-Tier Context Architecture** ✅ **Validated**

1. **User Context** (`/usr/`) - No setup required, direct storage
2. **Company Context** (`/identity--{uuid}/`) - Setup required, categorized storage  
3. **Incident Context** (`/incident--{uuid}/`) - Setup required, evidence categorization

#### **Context Operation Patterns** ✅ **Validated**

```python
# User context (direct storage, no setup)
result = invoke_save_user_context_block(obj_path, context_path)

# Company context (categorized storage, setup required)
result = invoke_create_company_context(context_type, input_data)  # Initialize first
context_type = {"context_type": "users"}
result = invoke_save_company_context_block(obj_path, context_path, context_type)

# Incident context (evidence categorization, setup required) - NEW PATTERN
result = invoke_create_incident_context(obj_path, context_path)  # Initialize incident
context_type = {"context_type": "observables"}  # Specify evidence category
result = invoke_save_incident_context_block(obj_path, context_path, context_type)
```

### 5. **Orchestration Notebook Sequence** - **Extended Implementation**

#### **Validated Notebook Progression** ✅ **Complete Chain**
