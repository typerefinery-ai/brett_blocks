    "# Step 2: Phishing Incident - The Alert\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚨 3:47 AM - The SIEM Fires\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system just detected something suspicious:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **ALERT**: Phishing pattern detected  \n",
    "> **Target**: Executive email account  \n",
    "> **Threat**: Malicious URL in email body  \n",
    "> **Severity**: HIGH  \n",
    "> **Confidence**: 87%\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how most incidents start - **automated detection before human awareness**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📖 The Story\n",
    "\n",
    "An attacker sent a phishing email to your company's CEO:\n",
    "- **From**: attacker@evil.com (spoofed sender)\n",
    "- **To**: ceo@victim-company.com (your CEO from Step_1)\n",
    "- **Subject**: \"Urgent: Verify your account\"\n",
    "- **Body**: Contains a malicious URL: `https://evil.com/phish`\n",
    "\n",
    "The SIEM analyzed the email, recognized the phishing pattern, and created an **automated alert**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job: **Create the incident** to track this threat.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What You'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "**An incident with its evidence trail**:\n",
    "1. **Observable Evidence** (What was detected)\n",
    "   - URL SCO (the malicious link)\n",
    "   - Email-message SCO (the phishing email)\n",
    "   - Observed-data wrapping both\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Detection** (How it was found)\n",
    "   - Indicator (the pattern: \"URL in email body matches evil.com\")\n",
    "   - Sighting with `sighting-alert` extension (SIEM detection)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Event Timeline** (When it happened)\n",
    "   - Event derived from sighting (alert-created)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Impact Assessment** (What's at risk)\n",
    "   - Impact object (potential account compromise)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Response Plan** (What to do)\n",
    "   - 5 investigation tasks with dependencies\n",
    "   - 3 sequence workflows grouping tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Incident Container** (The whole investigation)\n",
    "   - Incident object with IncidentCoreExt\n",
    "   - References to all evidence, events, tasks, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total**: ~25+ STIX objects creating a complete incident graph\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🗺️ The Journey: Six Acts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Act 1: Setup** (Libraries, paths, utilities)\n",

    "\n",
    "**Act 6: Incident Container** (Tie it all together)\n",
    "- Pattern 3.1: Incident Container\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎓 What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pattern 3.1 (Incident Container)**: How incidents reference all their evidence\n",
    "2. **Pattern 3.3 (Sighting-Alert)**: How automated detections are recorded\n",
    "3. **Pattern 3.4 (Event Derivation)**: How sightings become timeline events\n",
    "4. **Pattern 3.5 (Task Integration)**: How investigation tasks are managed\n",
    "5. **Pattern 3.6 (Impact Assessment)**: How risk is quantified\n",
    "6. **Pattern 3.7 (Sequence Workflows)**: How tasks are orchestrated\n",
    "7. **Pattern 3.8 (Email Communication Graph)**: How phishing emails are modeled\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Step_0_User_Setup.ipynb** - You need YOUR identity (the analyst)  \n",
    "✅ **Step_1_Company_Setup.ipynb** - You need the CEO identity (the victim)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔜 What's Next\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step_3** will extend this incident with a **user report** (anecdote). The CEO will submit a report saying \"I received this suspicious email.\" That's a second piece of evidence pointing to the same incident - showing how incidents **grow** as evidence accumulates.\n",
