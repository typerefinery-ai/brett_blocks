    "\n",
    "1. **Pattern 3.9 (Anecdote Provenance)**: Human testimony with full attribution\n",
    "   - WHO said it: CEO identity\n",
    "   - WHAT they said: The statement text\n",
    "   - WHEN: Timestamp\n",
    "   - ABOUT WHAT: Context references to original evidence\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pattern 3.10 (Impact Supersession Chain)**: How assessments evolve\n",
    "   - Initial impact: HIGH (based on detection alone)\n",
    "   - Updated impact: MEDIUM (based on user confirmation of no-click)\n",
    "   - Supersession: New impact references old one\n",
    "   - Preservation: Both assessments kept for audit trail\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sighting Extension Variants**: Different evidence sources\n",
    "   - `sighting-alert`: Automated SIEM detection\n",
    "   - `sighting-anecdote`: Manual user report\n",
    "   - Same pattern, different metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 The Complete Evidence Timeline\n",

    "### \udca1 Why This Matters: Multi-Source Intelligence\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question**: \"How do we know this was a real threat?\"  \n",
    "**Answer**: \"We have TWO independent sources:\"\n",
    "1. Automated SIEM detection (objective pattern matching)\n",
    "2. User confirmation (subjective human verification)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question**: \"What was the actual impact?\"  \n",
    "**Answer**: \"Follow the supersession chain:\"\n",
    "1. Initial assessment: HIGH risk (might have been compromised)\n",
    "2. Updated assessment: MEDIUM risk (confirmed no interaction)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question**: \"When did we learn it was safe?\"  \n",
    "**Answer**: \"Follow event timeline:\"\n",
    "1. 3:47 AM: Threat detected\n",
    "2. 8:15 AM: User confirmed no-click (5 hours later)\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph **preserves the investigation story** as it unfolded in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Key Insight: Incidents Are Alive\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates the core concept: **Incidents are not static documents.**\n",
    "\n",
    "They start small (a single alert) and **grow** as:\n",
    "- New evidence arrives (user reports, forensics, threat intel)\n",
    "- Impact assessments evolve (severity increases or decreases)\n",
    "- Timeline expands (more events discovered)\n",
    "- Response actions are taken (tasks created and completed)\n",
    "\n",
    "The STIX graph **grows organically** as the investigation progresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 What's Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "You could continue extending this incident with:\n",
    "- **Sighting-Enrichment**: Threat intelligence sources confirm it's a known campaign\n",
    "- **Additional anecdotes**: Other employees report receiving similar emails\n",
    "- **Forensic evidence**: Email server logs analyzed\n",
    "- **Response completion**: Tasks marked as done, sequences completed\n",
    "\n",
    "Each addition follows the same pattern: create objects, link them to the incident via `_refs` lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎉 All 4 Notebooks Complete!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step_0**: Created YOUR identity (the analyst)  \n",
    "**Step_1**: Created COMPANY context (organization, employees, systems)  \n",
    "**Step_2**: Created initial INCIDENT (phishing alert, automated detection)  \n",
    "**Step_3**: EXTENDED incident (user report, impact update)\n",
