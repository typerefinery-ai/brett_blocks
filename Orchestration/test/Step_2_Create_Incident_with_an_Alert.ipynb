    "# Step 2: Phishing Incident - The Alert\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚨 3:47 AM - The SIEM Fires\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system just detected something suspicious:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **ALERT**: Phishing pattern detected  \n",
    "> **Target**: Executive email account  \n",
    "> **Threat**: Malicious URL in email body  \n",
    "> **Severity**: HIGH  \n",
    "> **Confidence**: 87%\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how most incidents start - **automated detection before human awareness**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📖 The Story\n",
    "\n",
    "An attacker sent a phishing email to your company's CEO:\n",
    "- **From**: attacker@evil.com (spoofed sender)\n",
    "- **To**: ceo@victim-company.com (your CEO from Step_1)\n",
    "- **Subject**: \"Urgent: Verify your account\"\n",
    "- **Body**: Contains a malicious URL: `https://evil.com/phish`\n",
    "\n",
    "The SIEM analyzed the email, recognized the phishing pattern, and created an **automated alert**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job: **Create the incident** to track this threat.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What You'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "**An incident with its evidence trail**:\n",
    "1. **Observable Evidence** (What was detected)\n",
    "   - URL SCO (the malicious link)\n",
    "   - Email-message SCO (the phishing email)\n",
    "   - Observed-data wrapping both\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Detection** (How it was found)\n",
    "   - Indicator (the pattern: \"URL in email body matches evil.com\")\n",
    "   - Sighting with `sighting-alert` extension (SIEM detection)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Event Timeline** (When it happened)\n",
    "   - Event derived from sighting (alert-created)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Impact Assessment** (What's at risk)\n",
    "   - Impact object (potential account compromise)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Response Plan** (What to do)\n",
    "   - 5 investigation tasks with dependencies\n",
    "   - 3 sequence workflows grouping tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Incident Container** (The whole investigation)\n",
    "   - Incident object with IncidentCoreExt\n",
    "   - References to all evidence, events, tasks, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total**: ~25+ STIX objects creating a complete incident graph\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🗺️ The Journey: Six Acts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Act 1: Setup** (Libraries, paths, utilities)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Act 2: Observable Evidence** (URL, email, observed-data)\n",
    "- Pattern 3.8: Email Message Communication Graph\n",
    "\n",

    "- Pattern 3.3: Sighting-Alert Evidence\n",
    "\n",
    "**Act 4: Event Timeline** (Event derived from sighting)\n",
    "- Pattern 3.4: Event Derivation\n",

    "- Pattern 3.6: Impact Assessment\n",
    "- Pattern 3.7: Sequence Workflow Orchestration\n",
    "\n",
    "**Act 6: Incident Container** (Tie it all together)\n",
    "- Pattern 3.1: Incident Container\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎓 What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pattern 3.1 (Incident Container)**: How incidents reference all their evidence\n",
    "2. **Pattern 3.3 (Sighting-Alert)**: How automated detections are recorded\n",
    "3. **Pattern 3.4 (Event Derivation)**: How sightings become timeline events\n",
    "4. **Pattern 3.5 (Task Integration)**: How investigation tasks are managed\n",
    "5. **Pattern 3.6 (Impact Assessment)**: How risk is quantified\n",
    "6. **Pattern 3.7 (Sequence Workflows)**: How tasks are orchestrated\n",
    "7. **Pattern 3.8 (Email Communication Graph)**: How phishing emails are modeled\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Step_0_User_Setup.ipynb** - You need YOUR identity (the analyst)  \n",
    "✅ **Step_1_Company_Setup.ipynb** - You need the CEO identity (the victim)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔜 What's Next\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step_3** will extend this incident with a **user report** (anecdote). The CEO will submit a report saying \"I received this suspicious email.\" That's a second piece of evidence pointing to the same incident - showing how incidents **grow** as evidence accumulates.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Pattern 4.1 & 4.2: Sequence Workflow Orchestration**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've created Tasks and Events, we need to sequence them into executable workflows. Every Task and Event object requires a corresponding Sequence object to control execution order, dependencies, and workflow management.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Sequences Matter**:\n",
    "- Enable the orchestrator to execute tasks in the correct order\n",
    "- Track event timelines and dependencies\n",
    "- Automatically create start sequences and link workflows\n",
    "- Support complex workflow patterns (serial, parallel, conditional)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The 3-Step Pattern**:\n",
    "1. **Create**: Build the sequence STIX object with `step_type=\"single_step\"` and link via `sequenced_object`\n",
    "2. **Chain**: Use `chain_sequence.py` to auto-link into workflows (creates start sequences, updates `next_steps`)\n",
    "3. **Save**: Store in context memory for orchestrator execution\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll create sequences for:\n",
    "- `task` (initial alert triage)\n",
    "- `task_validate` (validate SIEM alert)\n",
    "- `task_determine_fp` (determine false positive status)\n",
    "- `event` (alert detection timeline moment)"

    "1. **Pattern 3.1 (Incident Container)**: Incident ties everything together via `_refs` lists\n",
    "2. **Pattern 3.3 (Sighting-Alert)**: SIEM detection recorded with metadata\n",
    "3. **Pattern 3.4 (Event Derivation)**: Events derived from sightings for timeline\n",
    "4. **Pattern 3.5 (Task Integration)**: Investigation actions defined\n",

    "### \udca1 Why This Matters: Incident Reconstitution\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, you can query the graph to reconstruct the complete story:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Query**: \"Show me the phishing incident\"\n",
    "**Result**: The incident object with all its references\n",
    "\n",
    "**Query**: \"How was this detected?\"\n",
    "**Result**: Follow `sighting_refs` → sighting → `extensions.sighting-alert.alert_type: \"siem\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Query**: \"What evidence was found?\"\n",
    "**Result**: Follow `sighting_refs` → sighting → `observed_data_refs` → observed-data → `object_refs`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Query**: \"What actions were taken?\"\n",
    "**Result**: Follow `task_refs` → tasks with their descriptions and owners\n",
    "\n",
    "**Query**: \"When did this happen?\"\n",
    "**Result**: Follow `event_refs` → events with timestamps\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph **preserves the complete investigation story** for auditing, learning, and sharing.\n",

    "### 🚀 Next Steps: Extend the Incident (Step_3)\n",
    "\n",
    "This incident is based on an **automated SIEM alert**. But 5 hours later, the CEO submits a report: \"I received a suspicious email.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Step_3**, you'll extend this incident with:\n",
    "- **Anecdote SCO** (user report) - Pattern 3.9\n",
    "- **Sighting-anecdote** (human verification)\n",
    "- **Updated impact** (lower severity since user didn't click) - Pattern 3.10\n",
    "- **Second event** (user-reported)\n",
    "\n",
    "The incident will **grow** as new evidence arrives. You'll see how:\n",
    "- Multiple sightings point to the same incident\n",
    "- Impact assessments can supersede each other\n",
    "- Events build a complete timeline\n",
    "\n",
    "**The incident is alive - it evolves as the investigation progresses.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎉 Step_2 Complete!\n",
    "\n",
    "You've created a complete incident investigation from scratch. You now understand:\n",
    "- How evidence is documented (observables)\n",
    "- How threats are detected (indicators + sightings)\n",
    "- How timelines are built (events)\n",
    "- How responses are planned (tasks + sequences)\n",
    "- How everything connects (incident container)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Welcome to advanced STIX incident management!** 🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
