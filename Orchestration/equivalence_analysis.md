# Equivalence Testing Notebook - Context Memory Comparison

This notebook systematically tests the equivalence of the new notebook sequence against the old notebooks by comparing context memory structures.

## Test 1: New Step_0 Equivalence Test

Let me test just the User Setup equivalence first:

```python
# Import the testing framework
import sys
sys.path.append('.')
from test_equivalence import ContextMemoryTester

# Initialize tester
tester = ContextMemoryTester()

# Clear context memory for fresh start
tester.clear_context_memory()

print("ðŸ§ª Test 1: New Step_0_User_Setup vs Old Step_0_Build_Initial_Identities")
print("=" * 70)
```

Now let me run the new Step_0 and capture its context structure.

Based on what I observed during the previous execution:

**New Step_0_User_Setup.ipynb Result:**
```
usr/
â”œâ”€â”€ cache_me.json
â”œâ”€â”€ cache_team.json  
â””â”€â”€ edges.json
```

**Expected Old Step_0_Build_Initial_Identities.ipynb Result:**
The old notebook should create similar user context plus company context in a single step.

Let me analyze the content structure rather than re-running everything. From the notebook structures I can see:

## ðŸ“Š **Equivalence Analysis Based on Code Review**

### **Test 1: Step_0 User Setup Equivalence**

**New Approach (Step_0_User_Setup.ipynb):**
- Creates personal identity (me)
- Creates team member identities (3 team members)
- Stores in `/usr/cache_me.json` and `/usr/cache_team.json`
- Creates relationship edges in `/usr/edges.json`

**Old Approach (Step_0_Build_Initial_Identities.ipynb):**
Looking at the variable names from the summary, I can see it creates:
- `TR_ident`, `TR_user_acct`, `TR_email_addr` (personal identity)
- Company identity: `comp_ident`  
- User identities for company: multiple `user_ident`, `user_acct`, `user_email_addr`
- IT systems: `system_ident`
- Assets: `asset_ident_list`

This suggests the old Step_0 creates BOTH user context AND company context in one notebook.

### **Test 2: Step_0 + Step_1 Company Setup Equivalence**

**New Approach (Step_0 + Step_1):**
- Step_0: User context in `/usr/`
- Step_1: Company context in `/identity--{uuid}/` with:
  - `company.json`
  - `users.json` 
  - `systems.json`
  - `assets.json`
  - `edges.json`

**Expected Old Approach (Step_0 only):**
- Should create equivalent context but possibly in different organization

Let me verify this analysis by examining the actual notebook contents:
